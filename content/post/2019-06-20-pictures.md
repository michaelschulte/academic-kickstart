So, the site is transferred and things look, in principle, nice. I used https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/ to rebuild my site from Wordpress (had to google around a bit to get the citations into BibTeX and postings transferred) ... nothing too fancy but, of course, all of this takes time ...

So, again, things are in principle fine - but there still seems to be a problem with pictures (and insecure links - man!) that link back to their old location on wordpress ... will try to fix this later ... for the meantime - enjoy :)
